    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h4>ACT 1 </h4>
<h4>PROLOGUE </h4>

<div> Two households, both alike in dignity,</div> 
<div> In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, </div>
<div> From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</div> 
<div> Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</div>
<div> From forth the fatal loins of these two foes </div>
<div> A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; </div>
<div> Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</div> 
<div> with their death bury their parents' strife.</div>
<div> The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, </div>
<div> And the continuance of their parents' rage,</div> 
<div> Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</div> 
<div> now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</div> 
<div> The which if you with patient ears attend,</div> 
<div> here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</div>
    <h4>SCENE I. Verona. A public place. </h4>
    <p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers </p>
    <h4>SAMPSON </h4>
    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals. </p>
    <h4>GREGORY</h4>
    <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
